	/// Strings are the most basic kind of Redis value. Redis Strings are binary safe, this means that

	/// A String value can be at max 512 Megabytes in length.

	/// Redis Lists are simply lists of strings, sorted by insertion order.
	/// It is possible to add elements to a Redis List pushing new elements on the head (on the left) or
	/// on the tail (on the right) of the list.

	/// Redis Sets are an unordered collection of Strings. It is possible to add, remove, and test for
	/// existence of members in O(1) (constant time regardless of the number of elements contained inside the Set).
	/// Redis Sets have the desirable property of not allowing repeated members.
	/// Adding the same element multiple times will result in a set having a single copy of this element.
	/// Practically speaking this means that adding a member does not require a check if exists then add operation.

	/// <summary>
	/// Redis Sorted Sets are, similarly to Redis Sets, non repeating collections of Strings.
	/// The difference is that every member of a Sorted Set is associated with score, that is used
	/// in order to take the sorted set ordered, from the smallest to the greatest score.
	/// While members are unique, scores may be repeated.

	/// Redis Hashes are maps between string fields and string values, so they are the perfect data type
